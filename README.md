# ScaleShift: Alternative Musical Notation Conversion Scripts

Welcome to [**ScaleShift**](http://scaleshift.app), a platform that bridges traditional musical notation with cutting-edge alternative notation systems. Our mission is to make music more accessible, intuitive, and visually comprehensible by providing tools to convert between traditional musical notation and various alternative musical notation systems.

ScaleShift enables musicians, composers, educators, and music enthusiasts to explore and utilise alternative musical notations. Whether you're looking to experiment with chromatic notation systems, explore isomorphic layouts, or teach music theory through visual innovation, ScaleShift provides the conversion tools you need.

## üéº Alternative Notation Scripts

This repository contains LilyPond files (`.ly`) that implement various alternative musical notation systems. Each file provides a complete implementation that can be used to render musical scores in the corresponding notation.

Each file is implemented in our public platform [ScaleShift](http://scaleshift.app), where anyone can use it to convert their musical scores.

### - **Clairnote** (`clairnote.ly`)

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clairnote SN was proposed originally by Paul Morris in 2018.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The proposal, as well as extensive documentation and software, can be found on the main website of the notation:

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[**Official Website**](http://clairnote.org)

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The current .ly implementation has been created by the original clairnote author and provided in the following link:

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[**Official implementation .ly file**](https://clairnote.org/lilypond/clairnote.ly)

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[**Official implementation Repository**](https://gitlab.com/paulmorris/lilypond-clairnote)

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The .ly file is published here as a copy of the original, to facilitate its implementation in the ScaleShift project

### - **Chromatic Lyre** (`chromaticlyre.ly`)

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Chromatic Lyre was proposed originally by Jan Braunstein in 2009.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The proposal, as well as extensive documentation and software, can be found on the main website of the notation:

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[**Official Website**](http://www.delos.cz/en/sheet_music/chromatic_lyre_notation.html)

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The current .ly implementation has been created by the original chromatic lyre author and provided in the following link:

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[**Official implementation**](http://www.delos.cz/en/sheet_music/lyrebird.html)

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[**Official implementation .ly file**](http://www.delos.cz/en/sheet_music/lyrebird.ly) current version: 23.05.18

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The .ly file is published here as a copy of the original, to facilitate its implementation in the ScaleShift project

### - **TwinNote** (`twinnote.ly`)

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;TwinNote was proposed originally by Paul Morris in 2009.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The proposal, as well as extensive documentation and software, can be found on the main website of the notation:

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[**Official Website**](https://twinnote.clairnote.org/)

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The current .ly implementation has been created by ScaleShift and is **EXPERIMENTAL**. It has been created following the documentation on the official website. We greatly value improvements to the current file. Some scripts can be found in the [software section](https://twinnote.clairnote.org/software/) of the official website.

### - **MUTO** (`muto.ly`)

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;MUTO was proposed originally by the MUTO Music Method Foundation in 1995.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The proposal, as well as extensive documentation, can be found on the main website of the notation:
